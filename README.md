This is an API Server to easly get grades and exam data from the OSSC grades server. The API uses Firebase as a backend in order to store none user related information about the exams, scraped from the website.

## üõ£ Concept

Here you can see a flow diagram on how to retrive the students grades and the scores of each exam from the OSSC site. Each box represents a single HTTP Request. Each request depends on information from the previous request.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage

In order to use the API you can either deploy the code on a PaaS (e.g. [Heroku](https://heroku.com)) or try it out locally.

## üåà Endpoints

üö® **IMPORTANT: Any confidential data should never transmitted over unencrypted `http` but instead be transmitted over `https`**

[GET `/ossc`](https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc): This is the production endpoint. Request made to this url will result in the server performing the request on the ossc website. This route requires valid login credentials. In order to send these you need to specify the `Authorization` Header inside your HTTP Request. The value of which has to be formatted as follows (pseudo-code):

```sh
Authorization: Basic $base64Encode($username + ':' + $password)
```

[GET `/ossc/test`](https://api.kuhlti.me/ossc/test): In order to reduce the stress on the ossc server, you can call the /test endpoint. This returns a boilerplate of the data you can expect from the production version.

## üåç Resources

- **[Using ESLint and Prettier in a TypeScript Project](https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project)**:

  Here are some core takeaways from this article.
  He has used the `.js` config files in order to add comments.

  **ESLint**:<br>
  A linter checks the code for any errors or missformated code.

  - `eslint`: The core ESLint linting library

  **TypeScript**:

  - `@typescript-eslint/parser`: The parser that will allow ESLint to lint TypeScript code.
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: A plugin that contains a nunch of ESLint rules that are TypeScript specific.

  **Prettier**:<br>
  Prettier does not check the code for errors but forces a particular code style.

  - `prettier`: The core prettier library.
  - `eslint-config-prettier`: Disables ESLint rules that would otherwise interfear with prettier.
  - `eslint-plugin-prettier`: Runs prettier as an ESLint rule.

  **Husky**:<br>
  To prevent files from being commited that don't follow the ESLint conventions Husky can be used to lint before commiting any changes.

- **[Get Started with Typescript in 2019](https://www.robertcooper.me/get-started-with-typescript-in-2019)**:

  - `tsconfig.json`: Used to configure the typescript compiler

- **[CLI apps in TypeScript via ts-node](https://www.geekytidbits.com/cli-apps-in-typescript-via-ts-node/)**

  - `ts-node`: The ts-node executable allows you to run your typescript code directly from within your terminal, without the need to use the typescript compiler `tsc`.

- **[TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter)**
  - I have used this boilerplate to setup all the scripts necessary to run the server.
